  :: Apply STEM/SSH/M to the author table.
     I calculated the coding by defining
     STEM = 0, M = .5, SSH = 1
     Then I took the discipline from the papers of every
     single author and took the mean value.
     E.g. Jane Smith had 2 STEM and a M paper: 0 + 0 + .5 / 3 = .16
          resulting in Jane Smith being STEM.
      I defined the intervals as such: STEM = 0 to .45, M = .45 to .55, SSH = .55 to 1

  :: Please fix the columns “firstYearPublished” and “lastYearPublished”, which are broken in the last data run.

  :: Discipline process (apply STEM/SSM/NA to WoS Papers by topics)
    - re-running Discipline process, optimized by resetting 'score' to -5 for shouldContinueProcess() and reduced
      execution time by 90%.
        - Previously shouldContinue() was checking for null (approx. 50 seconds)
        - when using -5 as default value, shouldConinue() took less than 4 seconds
    - API Batch of 10,000 takes approx. 30 seconds to process

  - getting everyone to open reports.csv
  - get definitions for topic keys - which is from where (WoS & Semantic Scholar)
  - categories to re-apply discipline
    - BekesiLenkey2018SubsurfacetemperaturemodeloftheHungarianpartoft
    - "Multidisciplinary" is not the same for our use, stem/ssh, remove as keyword
    - perhaps use "Both" as a label when matching on both SSH & STEM
  - key definitions for column names?

  == H index ==
  https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php
  - downloaded csv file with journal name & H index
  - match name of journal and apply H index, SJR score
  - check & see if we can run authors from SSPaper table to get their country code
    - Maybe run against it, do last

  Steps
  * re-apply stem/ssh topics
  * import Journal & Country rank csv file to mongo table apply H index & SJR score to all the papers on a new column

Orchid ID
    - strongly correlated to age
    - max out use of orchid ids
    - name change frequency from 10,000 names
    - run on sample to see how many have changed after marriage
    - get an estimate on frequency
    - look for orchid clashes
    - more prolific authors?
    - use to check if more that one person
    - people in academia longer
    - max 10% of people has orchid id
    - can be used to distinguish if someone w/ same name is multiple people

Capitalization
:: 3 letters or less
? - Can we assume a first name with only Capital letters are initials? e.g. "EC Tajima"
    ? - can we assume a first name in "normal-case" is an actual first name?

Years published in author table
? - should we include the years of the papers published in the author table?
    ? - what other data from the paper should be included in the author table?

Author exact name match
? - when there is an exact name match, can we assume this is the same author?
? - if no, should we match on topics?

Author Table
- include all related papers & topics?
- mapping initials + topics or lastname + topics to try & identify
    - "D. smith" & "Dan Smith"
-  Years published
- number of times a first name appears
- women changing their last names when married
- registry of women w/ changed names?
- match first names within topics?
? - published under alias?
