?? Wrong Years for published paper?
   	- only goes back to 2014, looks like parsing issue

========================
- take all authors w/ OrcId
    - run against api to see how many have listed "other names"
    - keep gender associated w/ orcid
    - add Other Name column to Author table
    - add count to First Names - each time author first name is added, increment the count
    - add Most Common First Names, Most Common Last Names table
        - add count for top 100 first names, top 100 last names
        - code 1 for someone who has both top 100 first & top 100 last name
    - variable for most common first / last name combinations
    - 5% of papers had affiliation on original dataset

    - add cross-checks using
        email,
        orchid,
        institutional affiliation
    -
    - add Topic to gendered paper tables
